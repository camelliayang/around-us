# Around Us

This is a web application that shows nearby places of interest. The time I took to finish it is around 20 hours including learning all the tools and framework from 0 (besides git).

## Technologies

1. Using React to build client app.
2. Using Node.js for the server.
3. Using Jest for unit testing.
4. Using Foursquare API.
5. Using foursquarevenues to get venues.
6. Using Create React App to get the raw application.

## Installing

```
npm install
```

## Start:

```
npm start
```

## Running the tests

Run tests by:

```
npm test
```

Check the coverage by:
```
npm test -- --coverage
```

## To do list:

1. Beautify the application. Right now don't have enough time to work on it. 

2. Get current location needs to wait for several seconds to show the result list now. So the user should be told to wait and the button should be disabled until I get the venues result. And if we got nothing, we need to tell the user. User experience here needs to be improved.

3. Designed to show 30 places everytime. Can make the results larger in the future.

4. Public it
